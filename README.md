### Hello, I am Arvy Nathaniel!
and you can call me Arvy.

A private tutor / data analytics & science enthusiast here. Currently transitioning into the data field, this profile serves as my portfolio which showcases my works in data analysis and science projects, as well as my safe zone where I track and feel the satisfaction whenever I finish and upload some works. Mainly uses Python to do data exploration, engineering, and a little bit of machine learning modelling. Welcome, and hope my works can offer some insights, however little it is!
